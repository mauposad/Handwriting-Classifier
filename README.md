### App Demo is in the Demo/demo.ipynb
Main code block should run the pop up window demonstration. Demo is run from jupyter notebook
need correct packages and libraries installed. Are listed at the top of demo.ipynb. Need to have a kernel with machine learning tools and libraries already predownloaded. Main course of action would be to download Pytorch for your environment as the model is built with pytorch and tensorflow
Run the main code block from the demo.ipynb notebook. 

### Downloading EMNIST Dataset
Due to the sheer size of the emnist dataset and the current backend issues with the dataset, manually downloading the dataset and implementation is neccessary.
Download the set here (download the binary formatted at the the bottom of the page): https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset
Once downloaded create a folder named data in the Models folder. Unzip the dataset inside the data folder. The path should now be "Models/data/gzip"
